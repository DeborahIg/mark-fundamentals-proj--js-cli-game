You have learned [how to read and extend the code for a **JavaScript CLI game**](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--js-rock-paper-scissors). Now, you're going to port your own over from Python to JavaScript!

## Learning Outcomes

- Interpret code written by others
- Use variable declaration and assignment in JavaScript
- Use control flow in JavaScript
- Use functions and arguments in JavaScript
- Use search engines as a learning and knowledge aid
- Specifying clear acceptance criteria

## Exercise 1: Setting the acceptance criteria

**Success criterion:** an `acceptance-criteria.md` file which specifies the [acceptance criteria](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices) of your game

## Exercise 2: Porting your game

**Success criterion:** a JavaScript version of your CLI game which passes your acceptance criteria.

In this exercise, you should rewrite the Python version of your game in JavaScript.

It does not need to be an exact translation:

- you don't have to literally translate line-by-line or function-by-function from Python into JavaScript
- you might choose to reorganise your code or logic as you port the game over
